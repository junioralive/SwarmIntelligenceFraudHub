### Abstract
Credit card fraud significantly impacts the financial industry, causing substantial losses annually. This project develops a fraud detection system using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize a neural network, enhancing the detection of fraudulent transactions. The application of PSO aims to refine the model's accuracy by efficiently searching for optimal neural network weights and biases.

### Introduction
Credit card fraud involves unauthorized transactions aimed at stealing money or goods. Traditional detection methods like rule-based systems and basic machine learning models often suffer from high false positive rates and lack adaptability to new fraud strategies. This project introduces a robust approach using PSO integrated with neural networks to improve detection rates and reduce false positives.

### Methodology

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Imputed missing values to maintain dataset integrity. Continuous variables were filled using the mean, and categorical variables using the mode.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scaled all features to zero mean and unit variance to ensure consistent weighting in the neural network model.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied PCA to reduce the feature set to the 10 most significant components, capturing essential data variance.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Employed the SMOTE technique to address class imbalance by synthetically generating samples for the minority class.

#### Model Implementation
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implemented a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of 20 neurons.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization**: Utilized PSO to optimize the neural network's weights and biases across 50 particles over 150 iterations, aiming to minimize the loss function.

### Results
The PSO-optimized model was evaluated for its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The use of confusion matrices and ROC curves provided a detailed assessment of model performance, indicating superior performance compared to traditional fraud detection methods with enhanced sensitivity to fraudulent transactions.

### Discussion
The application of PSO provided a nuanced approach to optimizing weights and biases, offering a global search capability that avoided the pitfalls of local minima typically associated with traditional gradient descent methods. This approach shows promising potential for high-stakes applications like fraud detection.

### Conclusion
Integrating PSO with neural networks effectively enhanced the performance of fraud detection systems. Future work will focus on exploring deeper neural network architectures and additional swarm intelligence algorithms to further improve accuracy and robustness.
